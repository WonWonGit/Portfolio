## What I focus on

<div>
<Focus>
In my first project at the company, I put in effort to align with the existing code style and format used by the company. Since we were working as a team, I paid extra attention to naming conventions. My specific role in the project was to implement customer experience and Q&A features, including a "like" button, ranking system, and search filters for clothing attributes such as material and fit. The filtering process required a lot of attention to detail, so I focused on making it as efficient as possible and anticipating user actions to prevent errors in the code.
