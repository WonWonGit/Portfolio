    <About>
   This is a toy project I worked on after finishing a JavaScript group study. The website, called "MMM," uses audio visualization to display visual effects on the screen based on the frequency of music. I used an indexedDB web storage to store mp3 files in blob form without any problems. I also implemented audio web API to enable users to control the music, such as playing and pausing.

## What I focus on

<div>
<Focus>
I have always been interested in learning more about the canvas element in HTML. During a JavaScript group study, I focused on creating visually pleasing websites using a combination of HTML and vanilla JS. I also paid attention to controlling animations to draw models on canvas one by one and handling synchronous processing.
